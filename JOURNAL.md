# Engineering Journal

This log tracks design choices, experiments, and learning outputs for the FunNet project.

## 2025-08-22 - Project Planning & Strategy Session (Claude)

**Files analyzed:** CLAUDE.md, project structure, maths_duolingo_plan.json, duolingo_style_full_stack.json, existing Next.js app

**Summary of changes:** 
- Created DECISIONS.md with initial architecture decision records
- Conducted comprehensive project assessment and learning strategy definition
- Established development approach prioritizing JSON data structure analysis

**Why this approach:** 
- Chose fast-track `/lesson/[id]` dynamic routing approach to maximize learning density while building real architecture from day 1
- Frontend-first approach allows immediate visual feedback and builds confidence
- Leverages existing question content to avoid mock data delays
- Matches developer's experience level and goals for rapid progress with deep learning

**What was learned:** 
- Project has excellent planning foundation (comprehensive specs, tech stack definitions, question content) but was missing required DECISIONS.md file
- Current state is initialized Next.js app with default template - no functionality implemented yet
- JSON question content exists across 3 topics (Fractions, Percentages, Basic Algebra) but needs standardization before component development
- Key insight: Data structure must be analyzed first since component design depends entirely on data shape

**Next step:** Analyze existing JSON question files and create unified TypeScript interfaces, then implement `/lesson/[id]` dynamic routing

## 2025-08-25 - TypeScript Interface Architecture Session (Claude + Human)

**Files created/modified:** src/types/lesson.ts (new), fractions_path.json (simplified)

**Summary of changes:** 
- Built complete TypeScript interface system for skill-based lesson architecture
- Created 5 question type interfaces (MCQ, TypeIn, TrueFalse, Match, Order) with discriminated union
- Designed hierarchical data structure: Question → LessonContent → LessonRef → LearningNode → Unit → Section → Topic
- Removed stars system in favor of simpler 100% completion + XP/badge progression
- Simplified fractions_path.json by removing version field and focusing on essential structure

**Why this approach:** 
- Bottom-up design ensured complex question types (most variety) were solved first as foundation
- Discriminated unions provide type safety while handling multiple question formats
- Hierarchical interfaces match JSON structure exactly, avoiding transformation complexity
- Learning by doing approach built understanding through hands-on decision making rather than passive code generation

**What was learned:** 
- TypeScript discriminated unions automatically narrow types based on literal type fields (e.g., question.type === "MCQ")
- Bottom-up architecture prevents refactoring by solving complexity at foundation level first  
- Interface naming and structure decisions have long-term impact on developer experience
- Data-first development prevents component design mistakes by understanding constraints upfront
- Trade-offs between matching JSON exactly vs clean internal types require deliberate choice

**Next step:** Implement `/lesson/[id]` dynamic route with data loading utilities to load and transform JSON into our type-safe interfaces

## 2025-08-26 - Complete Duolingo-Style Lesson Player Implementation (Claude + Human)

- src/components/lesson/LessonPlayer.tsx (new, complete lesson player)

**Summary of changes:**
- Built production-quality Duolingo-style lesson player with single-question focus
- Implemented complete state machine: answering → incorrect → retry loop → correct → continue
- Added 3 question types: MCQ (multiple choice), TypeIn (text input), TrueFalse (boolean buttons)
- Created scalable lesson data loader supporting multiple topics (Maths, Physics, Chemistry)
- Added full UX polish: progress bar, feedback messages, completion celebration, exit modal

**Why this approach:**
- Learning by doing methodology: human coded all components with step-by-step mentoring
- State machine design ensures users must answer correctly before proceeding (key requirement)
- Component architecture separates business logic (state) from presentation (UI)
- Incremental development: built simple working version first, then added complexity

**What was learned:**
- React state management with useState for complex user flows
- Conditional rendering patterns for different UI states and question types  
- Event handling differences: onClick vs onChange for different input types
- TypeScript discriminated unions enable type-safe question rendering

**Why this approach:**
- Data standardization over code complexity: checkpoint files using X pattern eliminated parsing edge cases
- Unified data structures enable single completion logic for both skills and checkpoints
- Smart navigation enhances UX by resuming learning exactly where users left off
- Nested data iteration with React maps teaches real-world component patterns
- Explicit lesson counts in data (Option C) chosen for performance over dynamic file system scanning

**What was learned:**
- Data-first system design: standardizing data structures simplifies code throughout the system
- React nested rendering patterns: sections.map → units.map → nodes.map for hierarchical data
- Advanced state management: coordinating progress tracking across lesson completion and unlock logic
- API design principles: making calling code clean even if implementation is more complex inside functions

**Next step:** Begin comprehensive 4-week enhancement plan focused on gamification system and production-ready features

## 2025-09-05 - Strategic Planning Session: 4-Week Enhancement Roadmap (Claude + Human)

**Summary of planning session:**
- Conducted comprehensive project assessment for resume optimization and job application preparation
- Analyzed current project strengths (full-stack architecture, authentication, database integration) vs industry expectations
- Identified gap: current project is basic CRUD + auth, needs standout features to compete in 2025 job market
- Designed strategic 4-week enhancement plan prioritizing high-impact features over breadth

**Current Resume Impact:**
> "Built a full-stack educational web application using Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript with user authentication via Supabase and progress tracking"

**Target Resume Impact (after 4 weeks):**
> "Architected and deployed gamified learning platform serving 1000+ users with React 19/Next.js 15/TypeScript, featuring real-time leaderboards via WebSocket, Stripe subscription processing, comprehensive gamification engine (XP, achievements, streaks), push notification system, and automated CI/CD pipeline with 99.9% uptime"

**Strategic Approach:**
- **Week 1-2**: Build complete vertical gamification engine (XP, levels, achievements, streaks, leaderboards, shop system, user profiles)
- **Week 3**: Add premium features (Stripe subscriptions, professional UI/UX overhaul, real-time WebSocket features)  
- **Week 4**: Production polish (CI/CD pipeline, email/push notifications, error monitoring, performance optimization)

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Focus on single topic (Fractions) to go deep rather than broad
- Build complete gamification features vertically vs half-implementing multiple systems
- Prioritize features with highest resume impact: payments, real-time systems, DevOps automation
- Simplify/remove: multiple subjects, complex skill dependencies, advanced analytics, multi-language support

**Database Schema Expansion Required:**
- user_profiles (XP, levels, display preferences)
- xp_transactions (earning sources and amounts)  
- user_streaks (daily engagement tracking)
- achievements + user_achievements (badge system)
- user_currency + shop_items + user_inventory (virtual economy)
- user_settings (notifications, privacy, themes)

**Learning Approach:**
- Continue learning-by-doing methodology with step-by-step guided implementation
- Focus on production-ready code patterns rather than quick prototypes
- Build understanding of enterprise patterns: payment processing, real-time systems, DevOps automation
- Balance speed of delivery with code quality and maintainability

**Why This Plan:**
- Transforms project from "student demo" to "production SaaS platform" 
- Demonstrates both technical depth (complex gamification algorithms) and business understanding (monetization, user engagement)
- Creates portfolio piece that stands out in competitive job market
- Provides rich technical talking points for interviews across full-stack, real-time systems, and DevOps

**Next step:** Begin Week 1 implementation with database schema enhancement and core gamification foundation (user profiles, XP system, achievement framework)
