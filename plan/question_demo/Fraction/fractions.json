          "type": "MCQ",
          "correct_feedback": "✅ Correct — numerator is the top number showing parts taken.",
          "incorrect_feedback": "❌ The numerator is the top number — it shows how many parts are taken.",
          "explanation": "A fraction has two parts: the numerator (top) and the denominator (bottom). The numerator tells you how many parts we have."

          "correct_feedback": "✅ Correct — 3/8 means 3 out of 8 equal parts.",
          "incorrect_feedback": "❌ The numerator is 3 (slices eaten) and denominator is 8 (total slices).",
          "explanation": "Fractions compare parts to the whole. Here, “3” is parts eaten, “8” is total parts."

          "correct_feedback": "✅ Well done — these are common fractions.",
          "incorrect_feedback": "❌ Remember: 1/2 means half, 3/4 means three of four parts, 5/5 means all parts taken.",
          "explanation": "Fractions are just another way of saying “part of something” — match them to their everyday meaning."

          "incorrect_feedback": "❌ Convert or cross-multiply to compare fractions with different denominators.",
          "explanation": "To compare 2/3 and 3/5, cross-multiply: 2×5=10, 3×3=9 — since 10>9, 2/3 is bigger."
