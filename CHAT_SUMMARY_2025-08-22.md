# FunNet Planning Session Summary - 2025-08-22

## Session Goal
Start FunNet project step-by-step for maximum learning, balancing rapid progress with educational value.

## Key Decision: Learning Strategy
**Chosen Approach:** Fast-track to `/lesson/[id]` dynamic routing instead of single component or backend-first approach

**Rationale:**
- Teaches multiple concepts simultaneously (Next.js routing, data fetching, React state, component design)
- Uses existing JSON question content (no mock data delays)  
- Builds real scalable architecture from day 1
- Matches developer's experience level and goals

## Current Project Status
- ✅ Excellent planning foundation (specs, tech stack, question content)
- ✅ Next.js app initialized with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Created missing DECISIONS.md file
- ❌ No functionality implemented yet (still default Next.js template)

## Week 1 Implementation Plan Priority
1. **JSON data structure analysis** (critical first step - component design depends on data shape)
2. Set up `/lesson/[id]` dynamic route  
3. Load questions from existing JSON files
4. Build interactive question component with full state management
5. Add lesson navigation (previous/next)
6. Basic UI polish and feedback

## Files Created/Updated
- `DECISIONS.md` - ADR-001 (learning strategy), ADR-002 (JSON priority)
- `JOURNAL.md` - Planning session entry
- This summary file

## Next Session Priorities
1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Analyze existing JSON question structure across topics (Fractions, Percentages, Basic Algebra)
2. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Create unified TypeScript interfaces for question types
3. **NEXT:** Begin `/lesson/[id]` dynamic route implementation

## Session 2 Update - 2025-08-25
**Major Milestone Achieved:** Complete TypeScript interface architecture built through hands-on learning approach

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Built discriminated union system for 5 question types (MCQ, TypeIn, TrueFalse, Match, Order)
- Created full hierarchical type system: Question → LessonContent → LessonRef → LearningNode → Unit → Section → Topic  
- Simplified gamification system (removed stars, kept XP/badges + 100% completion)
- Established bottom-up architecture approach as learning methodology

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- TypeScript discriminated unions for type safety with variety
- Interface design decisions impact long-term developer experience  
- Data-first development prevents component refactoring
- Bottom-up complexity management builds stronger foundations

**Ready for Next Phase:** Dynamic routing implementation with type-safe data loading

## Learning Insight
Data structure analysis must come first - trying to build components before understanding the data shape leads to multiple refactors. Better to standardize once upfront.

**Updated Insight:** Bottom-up interface design not only prevents refactoring but teaches fundamental TypeScript patterns that scale to complex applications. Hands-on decision making builds deeper understanding than passive code consumption.
